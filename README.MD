# CS2108 Project
## Requirements

1. Python 2.7
1. OpenCV

## Installation

### OpenCV:
1. Download here : https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.3.0/opencv-3.3.0-vc14.exe/download
1. Then follow these instructions : https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html
	1. If you're using Anaconda and created a separate environment, in step 6, you would copy it to `...Anaconda3/envs/py27/Lib`

## How to run
In cmd, just run `python portraitEnhancer.py $$$`, where $$$ is the name of the picture. I've included a few jpegs in the root folder

After running, four images will pop up:
1. Original Image
1. Image with teeth whitening
1. Image with face filter
1. Image with teeth whitening + face filter
